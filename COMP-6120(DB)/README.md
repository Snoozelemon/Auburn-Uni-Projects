#                                           Online Bookstore System
##                                        Populating and Querying Databases with SQL
Spring 2023

In this project, I've created a database for a hypothetical online bookstore system.
The system maintains information about books, subjects, supplier, and shippers. The
bookstore acquires the desired books from suppliers (e.g. Amazon.com), and ships the
books by shippers (e.g. UPS). The system also keeps track of orders, customers, and
employees.

<strong>Goal of this project:</strong>
1. Create and populate the bookstore database with MySQL.
2. Create a user interface using PHP and HTML to query and modify the data.
3. Write correct SQL statements for the queries given.
