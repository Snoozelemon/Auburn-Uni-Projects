#                                           AUbatch: A Batch Scheduling System

This project aims at providing us with an opportunity to design and implement a C program, where we are designing and implementing a batch scheduling system called
AUbatch using  the  <strong>Pthread library</strong>, <strong>condition variables</strong>&  <strong>mutexes</strong> in the C programming language<br/>

AUbatch is comprised of two distinctive and collaborating threads, namely, the scheduling thread and the dispatching thread. The scheduling thread enforces scheduling policies, whereas
the dispatching thread has submitted jobs executed by the execv() function.<br /><br />
Here is a Data Flow Diagram to have an idea about my project.
