#                                           CPMFS - A Simple File System

This project aims at providing us with an opportunity to design and implement a file system using C programming, <strong>cpfsys.c</strong> file system allows users to list directory entries, rename files, copy files, delete files, as well as code to read/write/open/close files.<br></br> I've used a version of
the CP/M file system used on 5.25” and 8” floppy disks in the 1970’s (support for CP/M
file systems is still included in Linux to this day). 
<br></br>
Here is a Design Implementation of this project:
