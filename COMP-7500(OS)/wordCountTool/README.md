#                                           Word Count Tool using PIPEs in Linux

This project aims at providing us with an opportunity to design and implement a C program, where two processes are cooperating through <strong>Unix Pipes</strong>. <br/>
Pipes is one of the first interposes communication mechanisms or IPCs in early Unix systems. Unix pipes offer simple yet efficient ways of communicating among collaborating processes. In this project, we focus on ordinary pipes that enable two processes to communicate in a producer-consumer fashion. In other words, a producer process writes to one end of a pipe (i.e., write-end) and a consumer process reads from the other end (i.e., read-end).<br /><br />
Here is a Data Flow Diagram to have an idea about my project.

Here is a screenshot of what to expect from this project,

The input:<br>
The input for this tool requires an txt file which contains a couple of words in it.<br>
<strong><italic>Note: The tool only accepts .txt file and it doesn't take anyother file.<italic></strong>

The output:
